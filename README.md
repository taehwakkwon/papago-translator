## papago translator with selenium(en2kr)

Naver supports papago API. However, the amount of text is limited which is so small.



Therefore, I made this program which helps you to translate tons of english sentences. 



This programs should be run in linux os.



Before get started run this following code on your shell.



```shell
git clone https://github.com/taehwakkwon/papago-translator.git
cd papago-translator
pip install -r requirements
apt-get update
apt install chromium-chromedriver
```



Have a great day😁
